Download "project.zip" to use as your starting folder.

The files/folder inside it that will (propably) not change are "package-lock.json",
"package.json", and "node_modules"

So, when a change occurs in src or public, you'll only need to look for the singular file in this 
repository and replace it with its old file, instead of constantly downloading the big zip file.
That will only be needed if a huge amount of files/folders were updated.
